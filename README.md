# neural_network_implementations_matlab
Implementations of a feed-forward and convolutional neural network in MATLAB based on the book MATLAB Deep Learning by Phil Kim.

The CNN implementation utilizes MNIST database drawn letters for training, which are included in the CNN folder. The originals and all credit can be attributed to the MNIST database at http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ .
